// Question: Write a program, with variable A, that increments from 5-10
// Have variable B decreases from 10-5.
// In each iteration, the sum of A and B is added to variable "sum"
// The conditon for each variable is "a <= 10" and "b >= 5"

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int a = 10;
    int b = 0;
    int sum = 0;

    for(a = 10; a <= 0; a + 5){
        for(b = 10; b <= 10; b - 5){
            
        }
    }
